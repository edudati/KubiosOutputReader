<p align="justify"><a href="https://www.kubios.com/">Kubios HRV</a> software is a device independent software, supporting several commonly used HR monitors, ECG devices and PPG monitors. Kubios HRV provides accurate and detailed HRV analysis for short- and long-term measurements and for all kinds of study protocols. It's a strong and validated tool for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability">Heart Rate Variability</a> analisys.<br>This software generates two files as result of a RR interval set. A .pdf file with graphics and results, and a .txt file with the settings and results.</p>
<h2>What does this code do:grey_question:</h2>
<p>Usually in a clinical trial, there are many different files from many different subjects. <strong>HUNDREDS</strong>... sometimes <strong>THOUSANDS</strong> of files with HRV analysis in total.</p>
<p>This code scans a folder with kubios output files, finds the txt files and consolidates all results into a single .csv file. Also this code extract the RR intervals used in each analysis and create a .txt file with only these intervals, then put all new files with RRs into a separated folder.</p>
